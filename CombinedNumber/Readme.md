## Problem statement

Write a function that accepts a list of non-negative integers and returns the largest possible combined number as a string.

For example:

\[50, 2, 1, 9\] should returns "95021" (9 + 50 + 2 + 1)
\[5, 50, 56] should return "56550"    (56 + 5 + 50)
\[420, 42, 423\] should return "42423420" (42 + 423 + 420)
